# Overview
zuspec-fe-py is a pure-Python extension that populates a data model (zuspec-arl-dm)
by introspecting classes that use the zuspec-dataclasses extension. The 
data model transformed by other extensions into useful outputs (eg Verilog, C, etc).

## Subprojects
While working on this extension, you may need to make changes to extensions
such as zuspec-arl-dm, vsc-dm, zuspec-dataclasses. You can find these extensions
in the packages/ directory. The packages/zuspec-dev-docs subdirectory contains
overall developer information about the structure of various extensions.
